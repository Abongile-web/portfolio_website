# portfolio_website
My portfolio website to showcase my latest projects and skills!

A responsive website that acts as my portfolio using HTML, SCSS and Javascript

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to showcase my projects and skills to potential employers and clients. It also 
showcases the technologies I use and how I implement them in my work.

Custom Html and Css is used to showcase my knowledge of the technologies without requiring any library. Sass is used for features such as mixin's and nesting to allow for 
a smoother workflow and helps to keep things organized while also allowing me to create stylesheets faster. Media queries are used to ensure the websites responsiveness. 
Vanilla javascript is also used to add some basic functionalty such as implementing a hamburger navigation for the mobile view.
